  <p class="text-xl text-center mb-4">Frequently Asked Questions</p>

<div class="border-8 border-[#6E6E73] rounded-3xl mt-10">
<Accordion6
question_4="Can you explain what you mean by your 'all-inclusive design services'?" answer_4="While not officially listed in my services, I've always harbored a bit of a passion for print design, content creation, and even some copywriting. It might sound a bit unconventional, but I genuinely enjoy these aspects, and if you ever find yourself interested, I'd be more than willing to give it a try!"
question_3="Can you explain your conversion optimization method?" answer_3="Yes, my conversion optimization method relies on user experience research and psychology. For instance, studies suggest that for a customer to make a significantly expensive purchase, there must be an equally strong emotional connection to the product. How does that happen? Through images, social media influence, and perhaps by adding positive reviews. I ensure that these elements are implemented effectively, leading to a higher conversion rate."
question_2="How do you ensure my website is SEO-friendly?" answer_2="I use a detailed checklist to boost SEO. This includes making sure the website looks good on all devices, speeding up how fast it loads, using the right words in the content, and keeping an eye on changes in how search engines work."
question_1="What platforms or technologies do you use for design?" answer_1="I primarily utilize Figma for web design, UI design, and product design. I find it to be a versatile and effective tool for most of my design needs. However, on occasions that require very specific manipulations, I turn to Adobe, leveraging its unique capabilities for those particular requirements. I also use Affinity as well to save money as the software is very simular to Adobe, but it all depends."
question_5="Can you explain your development process?" answer_5="My development process starts with a thorough understanding of project requirements. I break tasks into manageable steps, coding and testing iteratively. Regular feedback from team members is crucial to ensure alignment with project goals before deploying the code"
question_6="Can you walk us through your design process?" answer_6="I begin my design process by envisioning the overall concept and creating a mood board to capture the project's essence. After sketching and rendering visual concepts, I seek approval for refinement based on feedback. Multiple iterations are conducted until the design reaches its completion, ensuring alignment with the visual representation and project goals."
