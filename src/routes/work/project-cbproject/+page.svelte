      <p class="text-lg">
        I haven't had the opportunity to fully showcase my illustration and drawing skills with a project yet, so I decided to create a coloring book that truly highlights my abilities. While flowers are a popular subject in coloring books, I aim to infuse my unique style into each illustration. This project not only allows me to demonstrate my artistic vision but also showcases how I interpret and depict the beauty of nature through my art.

      I used Procreate to draw the coloring book pages. I began by determining the dimensions and then let my creativity flow. I usually start with a single item, allowing it to evolve naturally into something else. I enjoy the concept of 'create as you go,' which leads to playful doodling and drawing. The result is a fun, creative coloring page!

        The 8.25 x 8.25-inch coloring book features single-sided pages to prevent bleed-through and allow easy removal for display. Research shows that coloring enthusiasts favor this format. I aimed to create a product that feels like a true, professional coloring book while incorporating my unique twist and style.

      <p class="my-5">It's truly gratifying to see my work come to life! The biggest takeaway from this project is the realization that I could potentially sell this book and find a publisher. Although I may not pursue that route immediately, it's an option for the future. I've learned that creating a coloring book takes time and requires a lot of creativity!</p>
