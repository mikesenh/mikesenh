        This project marked my initial foray into professional web design during my time in school. For this assignment, I collaborated with a business owner to redesign their existing website, offering my services in exchange for college credit. Though the focus was primarily on design, there was no development or coding involved, as it was purely a design project for school.

          Modernization with Jakob’s Law
        </h3>
      </div>
      <p class="mb-12 mt-6 text-lg">
        In my UX design classes, I learned about Jakob’s Law, which emphasizes the importance of familiarity in user experience. I applied this principle extensively in this project, aiming to modernize the website by adhering to common design conventions. For example, I placed the navigation bar at the top and opted for three main sections instead of four. I removed unconventional elements and integrated familiar ones. Additionally, I revamped the color scheme with my own choices. This being my first professional web design project, I had limited knowledge of branding. Despite this, I believe the outcome was satisfactory, and I gained valuable insights from the experience.

      Re-branding Adjustments
    </h3>
  </div>
  <p class="mb-12 mt-6 text-lg">
    With the limited knowledge I had about branding at the time, I understood that making dramatic changes was acceptable as long as they still referenced the original logo. I took the existing bridge element and transformed it into a unique symbol. While I would have preferred to simplify it further, I appreciate the detail it brings. The result is a design that feels modern yet timeless, maintaining a strong connection to its roots. (While I didn't create the design from scratch, I made significant adjustments by altering the text, resizing the images, and experimenting with various color schemes.)

      <p class="my-5">As my first project, I learned valuable lessons about client collaboration and effective communication with businesses. The effort involved in reaching out to companies and executing the project taught me a great deal. Reflecting on this specific project, I recognize how much I've progressed in understanding fonts, layouts, and contemporary design. Overall, this experience has been immensely rewarding, and I'm delighted with the results.</p>
