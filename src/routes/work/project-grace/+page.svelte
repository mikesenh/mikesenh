      <p class="mb-12 mt-6 text-lg">
        After careful consideration, we decided to implement a new color scheme to
        infuse the website with a bright and optimistic ambiance. The chosen colors
        were white, blue, and orange, carefully selected to evoke a sense of
        freshness, professionalism, and vibrancy. By replacing the previous grey
        tones, we eliminated the dated look and embraced a more contemporary
        aesthetic. The new color palette allowed for a cleaner and more visually
        appealing design, creating a harmonious visual experience for users.

      During my time at The Grace Company, I had the opportunity to lead a UX research project focused on improving the website's conversion rates. we organized a focus group session involving a group of volunteer customers. The session was designed to be interactive and engaging, breaking the ice and creating a comfortable environment for participants to share their insights.
<br> <br>
The data collected from this focus group study guided us in implementing changes on the website, such as optimizing the navigation flow, streamlining the checkout process, and enhancing the product presentation.

          UX Design - User Driven Design
        </h3>
      </div>
      <p class="mb-12 mt-6 text-lg">
        In my role as a UX designer, I recognized the importance of understanding the needs and preferences of The Grace Company's customer base, particularly as the majority of the customer demographic was aged 55 and above. To gain valuable insights, I implemented a voting system to solicit customer feedback on visual elements and design choices.
<br> <br>
The voting system allowed customers to express their preferences and indicate which visuals they found most appealing. Through this process, we discovered that the user base favored larger images and a clean, uncluttered presentation of content. Taking into consideration their preferences, we prioritized showcasing images prominently and using minimalistic frames to allow for easy consumption of content.
