      <p class="text-lg">
        As a web designer for The Grace Company, my objective was to enhance and
        modernize the company's website, aligning it with contemporary design
        trends and creating a cohesive design system. Collaborating with a
        skilled team of graphic designers and marketers, we aimed to revitalize
        the brand image and improve the user experience, ultimately driving
        increased sales and positioning the company as a leader in the quilting
        machine and frame industry.

      </div>
      <p class="mb-12 mt-6 text-lg">
        To bring a fresh perspective, we opted for a simplification of the logo. We wanted to convey the essence of needlework and quilting in a subtle and refined manner. The letter "g" in the new logo design was crafted to resemble the point of a needle, adding a subtle visual cue that connects to the company's core offerings. By striking a balance between maintaining familiarity and introducing a contemporary touch, the new logo successfully captured the essence of The Grace Company's heritage while signaling its evolution into the modern era.

      Creating a Cohesive Website with the New Brand Identity
    </h3>
  </div>
  <p class="mb-12 mt-6 text-lg">
    After careful consideration, we decided to implement a new color scheme to infuse the website with a bright and optimistic ambiance. The chosen colors were white, blue, and orange, carefully selected to evoke a sense of freshness, professionalism, and vibrancy. By replacing the previous grey tones, we eliminated the dated look and embraced a more contemporary aesthetic. The new color palette allowed for a cleaner and more visually appealing design, creating a harmonious visual experience for users.

    In summary, the decision to shift from the grey and white theme to a white, blue, and orange color scheme, played a significant role in creating a cohesive and modern feel for The Grace Company's website. This transformation resulted in a visually appealing and user-friendly interface that aligned with the company's goals and aspirations.

    <p class="mb-6 mt-6 text-lg">
      During my time at The Grace Company, I had the opportunity to lead a UX research project focused on improving the website's conversion rates. we organized a focus group session involving a group of volunteer customers. The session was designed to be interactive and engaging, breaking the ice and creating a comfortable environment for participants to share their insights.
<br> <br>
The data collected from this focus group study guided us in implementing changes on the website, such as optimizing the navigation flow, streamlining the checkout process, and enhancing the product presentation.

          UX Design - Custom Tailored Experience
        </h3>
      </div>
      <p class="mb-12 mt-6 text-lg">
        In my role as a UX designer, I recognized the importance of understanding the needs and preferences of The Grace Company's customer base, particularly as the majority of the customer demographic was aged 55 and above. 
<br> <br>
I conducted a focus group with customers of that demographic, allowing them to share their preferences as they viewed different mockups of the website and provided feedback on what they liked and disliked. Through this process, I discovered that the user base favored larger images and a clean, uncluttered presentation of content. Taking their preferences into consideration, we prioritized showcasing images prominently and using minimalistic frames to facilitate easy consumption of content.

          UI Design - Designing with Psychological Insight
        </h3>
      </div>
      <p class="mb-6 mt-6 text-lg">
        In the UI design process, I strategically integrated principles from psychology and human behavior to enhance the overall user experience. By leveraging second-hand UX research and understanding various psychological phenomena, I aimed to optimize the website's effectiveness in engaging and converting visitors. By understanding and applying principles such as the curiosity effect, social proof, and risk reduction, I aimed to create a website that not only provided a visually appealing interface but also resonated with users on a deeper psychological level, ultimately increasing engagement to the site.
