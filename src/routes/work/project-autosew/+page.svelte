      <p class="text-lg">
        This software was designed in the '90s, and I've reimagined what it
        could look like with some new features. For context, this software was
        created to automate the sewing and quilting process for various
        machines. The objective was to develop a design that is not only simple
        but also user-friendly for individuals across the spectrum of expertise.
        We achieved this with a step-by-step system, something that was not
        integrated into the original product.

      Adapting UI Harmony Between Tablet and Mobile

  <p class="mb-12 mt-6 text-lg">
    During the design and brainstorming process, there was consideration of a
    mobile option replacing the tablet in the future. However, that idea was
    later scrapped. Despite this, I found enjoyable and innovative ways to
    optimize the UI, ensuring that both the tablet and mobile versions
    functioned seamlessly in a consistent manner.

  </div>
  <p class="mb-12 mt-6 text-lg">
    Originally, there was going to be a quilting wizard that spoke to the user
    on the left side of the screen, guiding everyone through the user-friendly
    software. After extensive consideration and UX research, we discovered that
    the best option was to isolate each feature into steps. Once the user has
    chosen a step, they would proceed to the next one. This approach was quite
    ingenious because it allowed us to get someone started in three easy steps
    without the need for extensive teaching.

        <p class="mb-12 mt-6 text-lg">
          The safe zone was the first step; it was the crucial prerequisite
          before anything could happen with the software, as the machine needs
          to know where to go. Of course, there were some questions about the
          naming, such as whether 'quilt area' was more viable because it was
          more literal. However, we kept 'safe zone' due to its connection with
          previous users and their association with the product.

        <p class="mb-6 mt-6 text-lg">
          In the original software, all features were accessible from the home
          screen, and interestingly, this remains true. However, through UX
          research, we discovered that placing the pattern picker as the second
          step was more practical. It turned out to be the initial action users
          took when getting on the machine. Of course, the safe zone came first,
          ensuring the machine knows where to commence quilting or sewing.

          The third step was placement, users were provided with a comprehensive
          set of tools, including a ruler and marking tool. I incorporated
          numerous images to enhance clarity regarding the functionality of each
          tool. This phase was the final step before letting the machine run on
          it own. The steps were kept simple enough for users to follow
          intuitively and we found that user just press “Start Quilting” when
          they follow the steps on there own.

        One of the most significant lessons I've gained is that in UX design and
        product design at large, a multitude of ideas circulate. Testing these
        theories I've learned the importance of rigorously testing in order to
        create the best possible product. I've come to realize that creating a
        digital product involves numerous steps, and flexibility is crucial for
        crafting great digital products.
